# dsm23 Parkrun virtual volunteer app

This is a repository is an attempt to replicate the functionality of the official parkrun app. I have become frustrated with the lack of functionality in the official app around deleting a mistake when the wrong barcode is scanned or an accidental press in the stopwatch app. I am attempting to address that with an example from [motion.dev](https://examples.motion.dev/react/swipe-actions).
